Run the program by first running "npm install" from the command line.
Next, you can optionally run the seed file by running "npm run seed" from the command line, which is not necessary but will clear the database and create a user and some crypto transactions.
Lastly, type "npm start" to run the website, hosted at http://localhost:3000

A user has been created already to house the cryptocurrency data, the username is admin, and the password is admin11111

It should be noted that only ten types of crypto are supported because the API does not return the names of cryptocurrencies, so all cryptocurrency names had to be manually entered. SUpported crypto codes are:
['BTC','ETH','BNB','SOL','XRP','LUNA','ADA','DOGE','AVAX','DOT']
